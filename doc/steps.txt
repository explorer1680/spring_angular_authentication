when access the url in localhost,
1st request: the url you enter, show status 302,
2nd request: login page, show 200,
3rd request: bootstrap.min.css
4th request: signin.css

after you login
1st request: login page, show 302
2nd request: the url you enter in first step.

in step1, the only difference is after you login,
the 2nd request and 3rd ... are download angular resources.
